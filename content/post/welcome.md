Welcome to vhdlcodes.com

I enjoy reading quotes and trying to apply them in real life. One of my favourite which took me on this adventure is

>Sometimes there is no next time, no time-outs, no second chances. Sometimes itâ€™s now or never. - Alan Bennett

This inspired me so much that I opened my laptop and started writing blog on whatever good tech stuff I knew about. First I started with C optimization, but later as my interest grew towards Hardware design, I started writing more about HLDs.

This gave birth to [vhdlcodes.com]

Purpose behind this website is to help hobbyists, students and engineers understand and playaround with Hardware Description Languages in a practical way by understanding and implementing the easy examples.

I have started working on my blog and videos again. I planned it earlier but life happened and I lost touch.

So enjoy the content!
