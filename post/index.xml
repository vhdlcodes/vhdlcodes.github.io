      <description>Most of the FPGAs have 7-segment decoders. These 7-seg displays are of following type:
 Common Anode  All the anode i.e. +ve pins of LEDs connected to &amp;lsquo;1&amp;rsquo; in digital design terms Cathodes i.e. -ve pins are used to turn-on or turn-off LED segments by setting &amp;lsquo;0&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;1&amp;rsquo;  Common Cathode  All the cathode i.e. -ve pins of LEDs connected to &amp;lsquo;0&amp;rsquo; in digital design terms Anodes i.</description>

      <title>Simple Clock Divider using VHDL</title>

      <description>When I started working with VHDL and FPGAs, the first ever project that came to my mind was blinking an LED. But since we all know that most of the development boards have high frequency clocks from around 20MHz to as high you can get. So if we directly connect that clock to LED the blink rate will be so high that it will not be visible to our naked eye.</description>

      <description>Welcome to vhdlcodes.com
I enjoy reading quotes and trying to apply them in real life. One of my favourite which took me on this adventure is
 Sometimes there is no next time, no time-outs, no second chances. Sometimes itâ€™s now or never. - Alan Bennett
 This inspired me so much that I opened my laptop and started writing blog on whatever good tech stuff I knew about. First I started with C optimization, but later as my interest grew towards Hardware design, I started writing more about HDLs.</description>
